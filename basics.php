<!-- Basic PHP syntax and functions -->

<?php
echo "Hello World!";
?>

// Echo is a function that prints out the string that is passed to it.
// Note: in php, all statements must end with a semicolon.

// Variables
<?php
$my_variable = "Hello World!";
echo $my_variable;
?>

// Variables in php start with a dollar sign ($).
// Variables are assigned with the = operator.
// Variables can be printed with the echo function.

// Data Types
<?php
$my_string = "Hello World!";
$my_number = 42;
$my_array = array("red", "green", "blue");
$my_bool = true;
?>

// Strings are sequences of characters, like "Hello World!".
// Numbers can be integers (whole numbers) or floats (decimals).
// Arrays are ordered lists of values.
// Booleans are either true or false.

//php doesn't require you to declare variables type before assigning them values.
